in order to build on docker it should be as simple as going to the project folder in terminal and running    docker build .

this builds it and it will show up if you run    docker images

however when doing    docker run    it throws an error 

however, it will still run if you do    javac Engine.java   and then    java Engine


in the end I apologize for this being very messy and not being well done. I won't make any excuses, I just need that 55% to graduate
